# UOCIS410 - Project 1 Improved Roll-A-Ball Unity Tutorial Game

Date: 4/5/2024



# Descriptions
A simple game in which the user controls a ball that rolls around and collects tokens which up the count until all tokens are acheived at which point a win text appears. 
This project was designed on Unity with C#. A modification of single and double jumps was added to the orginial tutorial. 



## Algorithm

In order to implement the double jump a check was added for collison with ground as well as a count to verify that only two jumps could be done between ground contact. Beyond that the jump itself is implemented with an application of pressure in the upward 'y' direction.
